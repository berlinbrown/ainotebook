========================================

Example CPU notes:
http://mycpu.selfhost.it/epj03.htm

- 8 bit processor, 8 bit internal and external data bus
- 16 address lines, 64kb addressable RAM and 64kb addressable ROM memory, 128kb
addressable memory total
- Architecture similar to Harvard (separate code and data memory, but only one
common address and data bus)
- Maximum processor core speed is around 10 MHz when 74ACxxx gates and fast
EPROM�s are used, but 8 MHz is guaranteed, and at least 4 MHz can be reached with
the cheaper 74HCxxx gates. Save operation is still possible with 74HCxxx gates and a
20MHz oscillator (core frequency approx. 6,7 MHz).
- 1 maskable hardware interrupt (IRQ)
- 5 x 8bit general purpose register
- lookup-table based ALU for maximum speed
- 61 integrated circuits (55 logic gate IC�s and 6 EPROM�s)
- User definable microcode, the microcode for a 6502 like CPU is provided
- Voltage operating range is 4.75V � 5.25V
- Power consumption is max. 150mA at 5V = 0.75W

More Notes on the ALU:

The unit supports 16 arithmetic operations, where eight operations take two 8-bit-operands and
eight operations take only one operand. The result of every operation is also 8-bit wide. The
ALU supports three flags: Carry, Sign and Overflow. Since the ALU is table-based, the
slowest operation takes only three clock cycles:
